    <h1>Exam Instructions for Students</h1>
<h3 style="color: red;"><u>Before the Exam</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Check the exam timetable carefully. Make sure you know the time and locations of your exams. Check whether you should go
    directly to an exam hall or a waiting room.</li>
    <li>Bring your Student ID Booklet or University Library Card (i.e. 650****). You will not be allowed into the exam hall
    without these.</li>
    <li>Do not bring any unauthorised material (e.g. written notes, notes in dictionaries, paper, and sticky tape eraser). Pencil cases
    and glasses cases must not be taken to your desks. These will be checked and confiscated.</li>
    <li>You are allowed to bring tissues and a drink (but not food) into the exam.</li>
    <li>Ensure that you use the washroom before arriving for your exam as you will not be permitted to leave during the first hour.
    In the case of listening and oral exams you may not be allowed to leave during the exam.</li>
    <li>Normally, you are required to answer questions using blue or black ink. Make sure you bring some spare pens with you. Do
    not bring a pencil case.</li>
    <li>Arrive at least 15 minutes before the exam is due to start (30 minutes before if your exam is in the Auditorium; TB329 or
    SSB329) and wait outside until you are allowed in. If you have to go to a holding room first, please arrive at the time stated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: red;"><u>the Exam Hall</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>As you enter show your Student ID card.</li>
    <li>Make sure your mobile phone is switched off and place it at the front together with any bags, books, coats etc. Then find your
    seat.</li>
    <li>Pencil cases/glasses cases: Students are NOT permitted to have these on their desks. Pens/glasses must be removed and
    placed on the desk and all cases must be left at the front/side of the room with other belongings.</li>
    <li>Remember that talking is not allowed at any time in the exam hall.</li>
    <li>Place your Student ID card on your desk next to your attendance card.</li>
    <li>Listen carefully to instructions. Students are required to comply with the instructions of invigilators at all times. For example,
    if you are asked to sit in a designated place then you must do so and you must not move.</li>
    <li>Do not turn over exam papers until told to do so.</li>
    <li>Where permitted you may use one standard translation dictionary. Dictionaries that have any English-English definitions are not
    allowed (e.g. The Oxford Advanced Learners’ English-Chinese Dictionary is not allowed; subject specific or specialised
    dictionaries are not allowed). Dictionaries are not allowed in CELE English language exams.</li>
    <li>Where permitted, students are allowed to use ONLY ONE dictionary during the exam. Invigilators will check that dictionaries
    contain no additional papers or written materials. Never bring someone else’s dictionary with you.</li>
    <li>You are not permitted to share dictionaries, calculators or any other materials during the examination.</li>
    <li>You are not allowed to leave the exam rooms in the first hour and last fifteen minutes. Note that in the case of listening
    exams, you are not allowed to leave the exam room at any time. If you need to leave an Oral Exam you must ask the Assessor if
    it is possible.</li>
    <li>Unless specifically indicated in instructions from the module convenor either on the examination paper itself or in a separate note
    from the module convenor, no extra pages of any sort will be provided for rough work. You should normally be required to do any
    rough work in the exam answer books provided and to draw a line through any such work not considered part of your answer.</li>
    <li>Everything you write (including any notes and rough work) must be in the answer booklet. Do not write large bold letters,
    numbers or equivalent marks on the question paper. Do not use sticky tape or any kind of eraser fluid to hide anything you write.
    You must draw a line with a pen through rough work or other notes not considered part of your answer.</li>
    <li>If you have a question or need more papers, raise your hand and a teacher will come to you. Teachers will not give hints or
    answers, so please do not ask for them.</li>
    <li>Keep your eyes on your own paper. Remember, copying is cheating!</li>
    <li>Stop writing immediately when the teacher says it is the end of the exam.</li>
    <li>Leave the exam hall quickly and quietly. Remember to take all your belongings with you. (Remember to collect all your
    belongings from holding rooms.) You must remain silent until after you have exited the building.</li>
    <li>Remember! Cheating is not allowed and action will be taken. For details see
